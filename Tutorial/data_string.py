# String is a data type in python. 
# String is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes. 
# We can primarily write a string in these three ways.

name = "Shubham" # Single quoted string 
b = "shubham"    # Double quoted string 
c = '''shubham'''  # Triple quoted string 

string_length = len(name) # len() to find length
shortname = name[0:7] # start from index 0 all the way till 7
character1 = name[1] 

word = "amazing" 
word[1: 6: 2] # "mzn

# word = [:7]  # word [0:7] – 'amazing' 
# word = [0:]  # word [0:7] – 'amazing'
