# input() This function allows the user to take input from the keyboard as a string

a = int(input("Enter number 1: "))
b = int(input("Enter number 2: "))
print("Number a is: ", a)
print("Number b is: ", b)
print("Sum is: ", a + b)

# It is important to note that the output of input is always a string (even is a number is entered).
