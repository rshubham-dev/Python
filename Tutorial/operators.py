# Following are some common operators in python: 

# 1. Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, / etc. 

a= 40
b=80
c= a+b
print(c)

# 2. Assignment operators:  =, +=, -= etc. 

a = 8-2 # assign 8-2 in a
print(a)
b = 6
b += 4
b -= 4

# 3. Comparison operators: ==, >, >=, <, != etc. 

d = 5<4
print(d) # raturn false

# 4. Logical operators: and, or, not.

e = True or False
print(e)

# Relational Operators are used to evaluate conditions inside the if statements. Some 
# examples of relational operators are: 
# ==: equals. 
# > =: greater than/ equal to. 
# < =: lesser than/ equal to.

# In python logical operators operate on conditional statements. For Example: 
# and – true if both operands are true else false. 
# or – true if at least one operand is true or else false. 
# not – inverts true to false & false to true.
