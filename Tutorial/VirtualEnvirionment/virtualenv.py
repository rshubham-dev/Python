# VIRTUAL ENVIRIO NMENT 
# An environment which is same as the system interpreter but is isolated from the other Python environments on the system. 
# INSTALLATION  
# To use virtual environments, we write: 
# Install the package

# We create a new environment using: 

# virtualenv myprojectenv # Creates a new venv 

# The next step after creating the virtual environment is to activate it. 
# We can now use this virtual environment as a separate Python installation. 

# PIP FREEZE COMMAND   
# ‘pip freeze’ returns all the package installed in a given python environment along with the versions. 

# pip freeze > requirements .txt 

# The above command creates a file named ‘requirements.txt’ in the same directory containing the output of ‘pip freeze’. 
# We can distribute this file to other users, and they can recreate the same environment 
# using: 
# pip install –r requirements.txt
