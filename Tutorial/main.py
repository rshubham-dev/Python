from module import myfunc

# IF __NAME__==  ‘__MAIN__’ IN PYTHON  

# ‘__name__’ evaluates to the name of the module in python from where the program is ran. 
# If the module is being run directly from the command line, the ‘ __name__’ is set to string “__main__”. Thus, this behaviour is used to check whether the module is run directly or imported to another file.
